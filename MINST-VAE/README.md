- [`AE.ipyub`](AE.ipynb): a comparison between CNN-AE and naive MLP-AE
- [`CNN-AE.ipynb`](CNN-AE.ipynb): on different training methods and learning rates in training CNN-AE. 
  NOTE: the model used in this version is generated by ChatGPT and includes a latent representation that's larger than the original image size.
  That's of course nonsense.
  Go to the next notebook for a real AE.
- [`CNN-AE-latent-space-size.ipynb`](CNN-AE-latent-space-size.ipynb): on the size of the latent space.
- [`CNN-AE-latent-space-structure.ipynb`](CNN-AE-latent-space-structure.ipynb): on interpreting the latent space.
